***Yesterday, 16 January 2025, the world lost a pure genius and a great visionary. David Lynch taught me to love the beauty of abstract and not to look for answers but for the right questions.
His art shaped me in so many different ways, and I am pretty sure this project is also partly inspired by his love of the absurd.
Today's post will be a tribute to David Lynch who is always in my mind.***


#### From Compute shader to Frag Shaders
Today while working on histogram 2.0, we are finally passing the data from compute shaders to rendering shaders.
This is what I was waiting for as it's closer to real-life example!

We calculate the data for histogram in one compute shader and store the data:
```javascript
const bindGroup = device.createBindGroup({
    layout: drawHistogramPipeline.getBindGroupLayout(0),
    entries: [
        { binding: 0, resource: { buffer: chunksBuffer, size: chunkSize * 4 * 4 } },
        { binding: 1, resource: { buffer: uniformBuffer } },
        { binding: 2, resource: { buffer: scaleBuffer } },
    ],
});
```
We also added one more compute shader to calculate heights of each histogram bar, which I am not going to put here otherwise it's too much code.
The most important part that we also get **scale** from there. 
And then we pass everyting into the Fragment shader:
```javascript
    const bindGroup = device.createBindGroup({
    layout: drawHistogramPipeline.getBindGroupLayout(0),
    entries: [
        { binding: 0, resource: { buffer: chunksBuffer, size: chunkSize * 4 * 4 } },
        { binding: 1, resource: { buffer: uniformBuffer } },
        { binding: 2, resource: { buffer: scaleBuffer } },
    ],
});
```
The outcome is the same histograms, but  drawn in GPU instead of javascript:

To sum up: we have **3 compute pipelines** here: 
- `histogramChunkPipeline` where we calculate histogram chunk by chunk;
- `chunkSumPipeline` where we gather all the histogram chunks from workroups into one chunk;
- `scalePipeline` where we compute the height of each bar of histogram;

and **1 render pipeline**
- `drawHistogramPipeline`, where we read histogram data chunks and scale data and based on that render the histogram.

Now can we do that on the same canvas on each frame?

Here we call our render function on each frame using well-known `requestAnimationFrame(render)`.
Bindgroups are also now created on each frame inside of render function.

An inportant moment is that we also created a **separate render pipeline** to render a video:
```javascript
    const videoPipeline = device.createRenderPipeline({
        label: 'hardcoded video textured quad pipeline',
        layout: 'auto',
        vertex: {
            module: videoModule,
        },
        fragment: {
            module: videoModule,
            targets: [{ format: presentationFormat }],
        },
    });

    const videoSampler = device.createSampler({
        magFilter: 'linear',
        minFilter: 'linear',
    });
    ```
And this is the end of WebGPU Fundamentals compute shaders articles!
Now lets try to tweak the given example ourselves.

At first, I got rid of histogram and tried to make half of the video black and white:
![black and white](/shaders-research-blog/images/bw-twin-peaks.png)

Yes, I know, we don't need compute shader for that and this can be done in Frag shader, but we're getting there.

Next, I changed the chunkSizes and the asked to make only red-ish pixels to become black and white (which in this case worked as blue segmentation).
This is my new compute shader:
```javascript
const k = {
        chunkWidth: 16,
        chunkHeight: 16,
    };
    const chunkSize = k.chunkWidth * k.chunkHeight;
    const sharedConstants = Object.entries(k).map(([k, v]) => `const ${k} = ${v};`).join('\n');

    const bwChunkModule = device.createShaderModule({
        label: 'bw shader',
        code: `
        ${sharedConstants}

        struct Chunk {
            pixels: array<vec4f, ${chunkSize}>
        };

        @group(0) @binding(0) var ourTexture: texture_external;
        @group(0) @binding(1) var outputTexture: texture_storage_2d<rgba8unorm, write>;
        @group(0) @binding(2) var<storage, read_write> chunks: array<Chunk>;

        const kSRGBLuminanceFactors = vec3f(0.2126, 0.7152, 0.0722);
        fn srgbLuminance(color: vec3f) -> f32 {
            return saturate(dot(color, kSRGBLuminanceFactors));
        }

        @compute @workgroup_size(chunkWidth, chunkHeight, 1)
        fn cs(
            @builtin(global_invocation_id) global_id: vec3u,
            @builtin(workgroup_id) workgroup_id: vec3u,
            @builtin(local_invocation_id) local_id: vec3u,
        ) {
            let size = textureDimensions(ourTexture);
            let position = global_id.xy;

            if (all(position < size)) {
            var color = textureLoad(ourTexture, position);

        // Check if the pixel is in the left half of the video
        // if (position.x < size.x / 2u) {
            //check if the pixel is red
            if (color.r > color.g && color.r > color.b) {
                let luminance = srgbLuminance(color.rgb);
                color = vec4f(luminance, luminance, luminance, color.a);
            }
        //}

        // Store in chunk
        let chunk_idx = workgroup_id.y * (size.x / chunkWidth) + workgroup_id.x;
        let pixel_idx = local_id.y * chunkWidth + local_id.x;
        chunks[chunk_idx].pixels[pixel_idx] = color;


        // Write to output texture
            textureStore(outputTexture, position, color);
        }
         }
        `,
    });

```
and this is the outcome:
