To make it more like a kitchen or a dining table, I want to add a table to my conspiracy theory digital "room".
First, we add the gltf:
```
    async loadGLTF() {
        this.gltfLoader = new GLTFLoader()
        this.gltf = await this.gltfLoader.loadFromUrl('./table.glb')

        this.gltfScenesManager = new GLTFScenesManager({
            renderer: this.renderer,
            gltf: this.gltf,
        })
    }
```
But  now  my table is added with UV map as a texture:
![curtains-gltf](/shaders-research-blog/images/curtains-gltf-uv.png)

 If I log my gltf.material, it shows the correct material of my table.
However, it doesn't use it.
To get our material back, we need to call buildShaders:

```
        const material = this.gltf.materials[0]

        this.gltfMeshes = this.gltfScenesManager.addMeshes((meshDescriptor) => {
            const { parameters } = meshDescriptor

            parameters.shaders = buildShaders(meshDescriptor)
        })
```

And then there it is:
![curtains-gltf](/shaders-research-blog/images/curtains-gltf-material.png)

Let's add a room around it. The example already had a box around logic, but I turned it into an actual room.
I could have just build planes as walls and separate planes for the ceiling and the floor, but because I'm working with shaders, I decided to check which plane is **wall** or **floor** which directly inside of the shader **using normals.**
I wrote a simple wallpaper shader for the wallpapers and here I use it only for the walls:

```javascript
    // Check if surface is a wall using normal
    let isWall = abs(fsInput.normal.y) < 0.5; // true for walls (where y component is close to 0)
    let isCeiling = (fsInput.normal.y) > 0.9; // true for ceiling (where y component is close to 1 and is positive)
    
    // Apply wallpaper only to walls
    var wallpaper: vec3f;
    if (isWall) {
        wallpaper = applyWallpaper(shading.color, fsInput.uv);
    } else if (isCeiling) {
        wallpaper = vec3f(254.0 / 256.0, 253.0 / 256.0, 238.0 / 256.0); // ceiling color
    } else {
        var floorColor: vec3f = vec3f(55.0 / 256.0, 23.0 / 256.0, 4.0 / 256.0); // floor color
        //add a bit of shadow in the center
        let center = vec2f(0.5, 0.15);
        let distance = length(fsInput.uv - center);
        let shadow = 1.0 - smoothstep(0.15, 0.2, distance);
        wallpaper = mix(floorColor, vec3f(36.0 / 256.0, 14.0 / 256.0, 1.0 / 256.0), shadow);
    }
```

Then I added 3 most common conspiracy theories and this is how it looks:
