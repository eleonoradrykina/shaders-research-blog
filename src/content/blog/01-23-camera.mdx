#### Camera

After taking a day off, I got back to fixing my "Orbit Controls" by going away from OrbitControls.

The main idea is:
<Takeaway>
 I want to always LookAt my object (let's look right at it for now), and the camera will be rotating around it with fixed radius.
 The user rotates camera around the object with Left and Right controls, and goes back and forward with Backward and Forward controls. 
 I will use the angle of camera rotation to calculate absolute values of "back" and "forward" movement.
</Takeaway>

This is the setup of the demo, still using physics here so that I don't have to change too much:
```javascript
 useFrame((state, delta) => {

        /**
         * Controls
         */
        const { forward, backward, left, right } = getKeys()

        //Empty statements for now:

        if (forward) {

            }
        if (backward) {
     
            }
        if (left) {

            }
        if (right) {

            }

        /**
         * Camera
         */
        const bodyPosition = body.current.translation()


        const cameraPosition = new THREE.Vector3()

        //Camera is following orbit with a set a radius around the body
        cameraPosition.x = bodyPosition.x + Math.cos(angle) * radius //depends on rotation
        cameraPosition.y = bodyPosition.y + 0.5 // always a bit higher than our body
        cameraPosition.z = bodyPosition.z + Math.sin(angle) * radius //depends on rotation

        const cameraTarget = new THREE.Vector3()
        
        smoothedCameraPosition.lerp(cameraPosition, 5 * delta)
        smoothedCameraTarget.lerp(cameraTarget, 5 * delta )

        state.camera.position.copy(smoothedCameraPosition)
        state.camera.lookAt(smoothedCameraTarget)

    })
```

I saw that we can get Vector from radius and angle and SPherical, but I want to do it myself so I have more control over the position and its set more explivitly:
cameraPosition.setFromSpherical(new THREE.Spherical(radius, angle, 0))

With radius set to 3 this is how it looks:

Now let's try to change the angle and orbit around the body:
```javascript
        if (forward) {
            }
        if (backward) {
     
            }
        if (left) {
            setAngle(angle + 0.1*delta)
            }
        if (right) {
            setAngle(angle - 0.1*delta)
            }
        
```
At first I have not noticed much so here I've added some random cubes to see the actual rotation and position change:

It works, but a little bit too slow. Let's speed it up and try to move the capsule on forward and backward:

```javascript
    useFrame((state, delta) => {

        /**
         * Controls
         */
        const { forward, backward, left, right } = getKeys()

        const impulseStrength = 0.2 * delta

        const direction = new THREE.Vector3()

        if (forward) {
            direction.x = -Math.cos(angle) * impulseStrength
            direction.z = -Math.sin(angle) * impulseStrength
            }
        if (backward) {
            direction.x = Math.cos(angle) * impulseStrength
            direction.z = Math.sin(angle) * impulseStrength
            }
        if (left) {
            setAngle(angle + 0.5*delta)
            }
        if (right) {
            setAngle(angle - 0.5*delta)
            }
        
        body.current.applyImpulse(direction)

        /**
         * Camera
         */
        const bodyPosition = body.current.translation()


        const cameraPosition = new THREE.Vector3()
        cameraPosition.x = bodyPosition.x + Math.cos(angle) * radius
        cameraPosition.y = bodyPosition.y + 0.5
        cameraPosition.z = bodyPosition.z + Math.sin(angle) * radius

        const cameraTarget = new THREE.Vector3()
        cameraTarget.copy(bodyPosition)
        
        smoothedCameraPosition.lerp(cameraPosition, 5 * delta)
        smoothedCameraTarget.lerp(cameraTarget, 5 * delta )

        state.camera.position.copy(smoothedCameraPosition)
        state.camera.lookAt(smoothedCameraTarget)

    })
    ```
And it works like this:
<video controls muted autopolay loop width="800" src="/shaders-research-blog/images/orbit-controls-demo.mp4"></video>

I think this is a good time for a confession: as I write the blog alongside with coding, sometimes I am changing snippets of code that I've just pasted here and don't understand why I can't see changes in my project...
This is why it's a good idea to take a break from time to time. 
This is final result in my experience (I took the ceiling out for the moment):
<video controls muted autopolay loop width="800" src="/shaders-research-blog/images/controls-final.mp4"></video>

I also understood that even I am lost in my rooms from the capsule perspective and maybe there's no need to hide secret *"transporting"* areas for even greater confusion... will leave it for now.

Let's add one more wallpaper texture and the floor texture!

#### Floor
As usual, first let's check that our frag shader works:
![check](/shaders-research-blog/images/check.png)

I tried other Worley noise for the difference, but I did not understand how to use itðŸ¤¨ðŸ¤¨
![check](/shaders-research-blog/images/worley-noise.png)

Putting Perlin noise for now and will get back to Worley later one more time.
I've also added Leva controls (I should have done it long time ago):

<video controls muted autopolay loop width="800" src="/shaders-research-blog/images/carpet-noise.mp4"></video>

I've got feedback from Ella that floor looks weirdly pixelated (I thought it were just my eyes at this point), putting step function to cut off blurred mixing helped:
```javascript
    float noise = step(threshold, cnoise(vUv * scale));
```

I might tweak it a bit later as well as I am not quite happy with this noise.

#### Wallpaper 
I want to have mix of walls with wallpapers and plain walls. This time I want to create stripes with some more complex wavy simmetrical ornament.
But for today just to start with I added stripes and paper texture. The logic is quite similar to previous wallpaper, the most interesting part is ahead.

This is what I have for today, I also tweaked camera target a bit above the bosy to get a better angle while navigating the experience:
<video controls muted autopolay loop width="800" src="/shaders-research-blog/images/24-jan-gameplay.mp4"></video>

For tomorrow I am planning to work on the second wallpaper, tweaking the light for the scene, and after that I can start conecting my rooms!
I already miss WGSL a little bit...
