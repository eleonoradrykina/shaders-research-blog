#### Roadmap

I tried to come up with a roadmap for my research, but for now I was able only to have very rough timeline:
![timeline](/shaders-research-blog/images/timeline.png)

I think of my features more of like happy accidents during research, but I will plan them more precisely this week for sure.
Meanwhile, I also went back to the very beginning of WebGPU Fundamentals.

#### WebGPU Fundamentals

The first thing that caught my eye was that **WebGPU is an asynchronous API** and is used inside of an **async function**.
Another thing was **requesting an adaper**:
```javascript
async function main() {
  const adapter = await navigator.gpu?.requestAdapter();
  const device = await adapter?.requestDevice();
  if (!device) {
    fail('need a browser that supports WebGPU');
    return;
  }
}
main();
```
The adapter represents a specific GPU. Some devices have multiple GPUs.

Okay, now an important takeaway:
<Takeaway>
"Shaders are written in a language called WebGPU Shading Language (WGSL) which is often pronounced wig-sil."
I need to train it more: ***WIG-SIL***
</Takeaway>

By the time I got to a red triangle on canvas, I had this conspect in Figma:

Now it makes more sense, so we can move further to **running computations on the GPU.**
