#### Cleaning up the code
First thing was to make my code a bit more clear and sustainable after all manual tweaks.

I re-drew the plan and separated the walls into groups for convenience:
![new floor plan](/shaders-research-blog/images/floor-plan-2.jpg)

Here how it looks in debug mode: 
![new floor plan react](/shaders-research-blog/images/floor-plan-react.png)

```javascript

    export default function Corridor() {

    return <>
        <Floor size={ 16 }/>
        {/* GROUP A*/}
        <WallHorizontal position={ [-9.7, 0.75, -4] } length = {12} />
        <WallVertical position={ [-3.85, 0.75, -8.0] }length = {8}/>

        {/* GROUP B*/}
        <WallHorizontal position={ [-7.0, 0.75, -20] }length = {10 } />
        <WallVertical position={ [-6.6, 0.75, -25.0] }length = {9.75}/>

        {/* GROUP C*/}
        <WallHorizontal position={ [12.7, 0.75, -22] } length = {6}/>
        <WallVertical position={ [6.6, 0.75, -20.65] }length = {13}/>
        <WallHorizontal position={ [8.7, 0.75, -14] } length = {14}/>

        {/* GROUP D*/}
        <WallVertical position={ [6.6, 0.75, -2.15] }length = {8}/>

        <BoundsForward length={ 16} />
        {/* <Ceiling size={ 16 }/> */}
    </>
}
```

#### Camera movement 
My next question is how I move the camera?
I am using Rapier with R3F for moving my capsule around. Physics engine and ``<RigidBody/>`` prevents capsule from going into the walls so I don't have to think about coding the bounds myself.
Right now the camera always follows the capsule and looks at it. This creates feeling of looking only straight ahead.
But my experience is very spatial, so we need to let the user to be able to look around.
This is the code for the camera I started with:
```javascript
...

        /**
         * Camera
         */
        const bodyPosition = body.current.translation()

        const cameraPosition = new THREE.Vector3()
        cameraPosition.copy(bodyPosition)
        cameraPosition.z += 2.25
        cameraPosition.y += 0.65

        const cameraTarget = new THREE.Vector3()
        cameraTarget.copy(bodyPosition)
        cameraTarget.y += 0.25 
        cameraTarget.z -= 2.25

        
        smoothedCameraPosition.lerp(cameraPosition, 5 * delta)
        smoothedCameraTarget.lerp(cameraTarget, 5 * delta )

        state.camera.position.copy(smoothedCameraPosition)
        state.camera.lookAt(smoothedCameraTarget)
```

At first, I added looking to the sides while going sideways, adding CameraRotation together with the impulse:
```javascript
        /**
         * Controls
         */
        const { forward, backward, left, right, jump } = getKeys()

        const impulse = { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 }
        const cameraRotation = { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 }


        const impulseStrength = 0.1 * delta

        if (forward) {
                impulse.z -= impulseStrength
            }
        if (backward) {
                impulse.z += impulseStrength
            }
        if (left) {
                impulse.x -= impulseStrength
                cameraRotation.x -= 1.5
            }
        if (right) {
                impulse.x += impulseStrength
                cameraRotation.x += 1.5
            }
            
        body.current.applyImpulse(impulse)


        /**
         * Camera
         */
        const bodyPosition = body.current.translation()

        const cameraPosition = new THREE.Vector3()
        cameraPosition.copy(bodyPosition)
        cameraPosition.z += 2.25
        cameraPosition.y += 0.65

        const cameraTarget = new THREE.Vector3()
        cameraTarget.copy(bodyPosition)
        cameraTarget.y += 0.25 
        cameraTarget.z -= 2.25
        cameraTarget.x += cameraRotation.x

        
        smoothedCameraPosition.lerp(cameraPosition, 5 * delta)
        smoothedCameraTarget.lerp(cameraTarget, 5 * delta )
```
But this gave very limited field of view which also did not work smoothly with the movement.

Then, I thought what if detach LookAt from the capsule for a second? But then the position is still updating each frame causing this camera shaking:
<video controls muted autopolay loop width="800" src="/shaders-research-blog/images/camera-LAT-bug.mp4"></video>

Then I realised: we need to attach the camera to the capsule **only when we're moving** the capusle, letting user to look around when we're standing at the same place.

So I've added updating camera on Each frame only if we're moving:
```javascript
        if (forward || backward || left || right || jump) {
            state.camera.position.copy(smoothedCameraPosition)
            state.camera.lookAt(smoothedCameraTarget)
        }
```

And set the bounds on the rbitControls because it is now enabled when the user does not move:
```javascript
        <OrbitControls 
            enablePan={ false }
            enableZoom={ false }
            maxPolarAngle={ Math.PI / 2 }
            minPolarAngle={ Math.PI / 2 }
            maxAzimuthAngle={ Math.PI / 2 }
            minAzimuthAngle={ -Math.PI / 2 }
            makeDefault 
        />
```
I also tweaked the inital camera position so that camera starts from the correct place. 
It looks extremely weird, but I think it's closer to what I want:

<video controls muted autopolay loop width="800" src="/shaders-research-blog/images/camera-movement-bug.mp4"></video>

The problem is that my camera does not "remember" where we were before we stopped moving. I tried to fix that but I think I am missing something here.
I compared states of camera while moving and after, but they look the same:

I will think about it more later, for now I switched back to "straight" camera
