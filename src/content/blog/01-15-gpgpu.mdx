#### GPGPU

So to pick up where I left off, I want to understand how **Frame Buffers** and **Ping-ponging** works to be able:
- compare it with WGSL compute shaders
- work on my Memories Room no. 2

<Takeaway>
So, we have a texture in our **Frame Buffer Object** which we can use for our vertices position instead of simply rendering it, like we would do normally.
Because we **can not read and write** to the same Frame Buffer Object at the same time, we will update it and then exchange them to each other (*ping-ponging*):
