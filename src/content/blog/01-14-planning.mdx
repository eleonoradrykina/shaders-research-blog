#### WebGPU Fundamentals

I am finishing going through textures lessons, including using pictures and videos as textures. I don't think I am going to use loading images on this low level, as I am limited in time, I need to be able to think of the **best usage for shaders**, something you would **not be able** to do on **Three js / React Three fiber** level.
Per my planning I need to start working on the set up and the scene tomorrow, so there are some things I will go through / revisit while working on my experience.

During this passion project I will not look into creating 3d Math on shading languages level, as Three js can do nearly everything much easier.
So my plan for WebGPU fundamentals is:
- Finish **textures** lessons (today)
- Deeper than fundamental **[Compute shader lessons](https://webgpufundamentals.org/webgpu/lessons/webgpu-compute-shaders.html)**
- Check **[bind group layouts](https://webgpufundamentals.org/webgpu/lessons/webgpu-bind-group-layouts.html),** I have a feeling I might need them
- **Particles** lessons â€“ [WebGPU Points](https://webgpufundamentals.org/webgpu/lessons/webgpu-points.html)
- Revsisting [How WebGPU works](https://webgpufundamentals.org/webgpu/lessons/webgpu-how-it-works.html) and [difference between WebGL and WebGPU](https://webgpufundamentals.org/webgpu/lessons/webgpu-from-webgl.html)


While doing so, there are things I know I will revisit anyway, such as [Memory layout](https://webgpufundamentals.org/webgpu/lessons/webgpu-memory-layout.html) and [Transparency and blending](https://webgpufundamentals.org/webgpu/lessons/webgpu-transparency.html)

#### Planning usage

Every day that I read another article from WebGPU fundamentals, I kind of scroll through the whole website one more time to see what became clearer and if new knowledge filled some spots that were blank before=)
It's time to make decisions now! Based on what I learnt about WGSL and TSL, I mapped out my *features,* put short *explanation about each context* and specified which *shading language* I am thinking to use for that:

The reason why I have **GLSL / WGSL** 3 times is because I am not sure what will be the better soultion at the moment and if I will be able to work with WGSL at the same level as GLSL. I am at least sure to highlight **compute shaders of WGSL** for my **room no. 3,** and to make use of **TSL** as more **textures / materials** for my **room no. 4.** As this whole project is a research proccess, these choices might change based on what I am going to learn on my way.

Then I also added visual references for each location:

**Intro and Corridor**

**Listening sphere**

**Room with a conspiracy theory**

**Distorted memories and outside outro**

#### Back to today's programme

I am finishing with textures, even though I don't think ia m goimng to load videos in WGSL, I went over the article, and the CubeMap article actually helped me to understand how normals abd environment map works.
I also have better understanding how lighting works together with normals, this is quite helpful picture:

Following the lessons, I have created [several demos in my demo folder in Liminal Russia repo](https://github.com/eleonoradrykina/liminal-russia/tree/demos/demos).
Now my brain is boiling with theory, and I want to switch to practice with some faster beautiful results:)
