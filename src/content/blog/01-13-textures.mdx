#### Vertex and Storage buffers
Before going further to textures, I've went through storage & vertex buffers lessons.
Buffer data is a new concept for me to use in coding, but it's one of essentials used in WGSL if you want to go further than triangles.

I already used **Uniform Buffers** in previous lesson, now we're looking into **Storage** and **Vertex** buffers.

One of the main differences of Vertex buffer is how shaders access it. We need to explain to WebGPU what it is and how it's organized:

![tell WebGPU how to supply data ](/shaders-research-blog/images/vertex-data-supply.png)

To the vertex entry of the pipeline descriptor we added a buffers array which is used to describe how to pull data out of 1 or more vertex buffers. For our first and only buffer, we set an arrayStride in number of bytes. A stride in this case is how many bytes to get from the data for one vertex in the buffer, to the next vertex in the buffer.

After several examples I also understood how to use the stride offset when passing attributes to shader:
```javascript
buffers: [
                {
                    arrayStride: 5 * 4, // 2 floats, 4 bytes each
                    attributes: [
                        { shaderLocation: 0, offset: 0, format: 'float32x2' },  // position
                        { shaderLocation: 4, offset: 8, format: 'float32x3' },  // perVertexColor
                    ],
                },
                ...
]
```

#### Index buffers
For optimizing vertices computaion, we can use index buffers to re-use existing vertices:
![index buffers](/shaders-research-blog/images/index-buffers.png)

Then the code turns into this, creating vertices and also **Index Data**:
```javascript
function createCircleVertices({
    radius = 1,
    numSubdivisions = 24,
    innerRadius = 0,
    startAngle = 0,
    endAngle = Math.PI * 2,
} = {}) {
    // 2 vertices at each subdivision, + 1 to wrap around the circle.
    const numVertices = (numSubdivisions + 1) * 2;
    // const vertexData = new Float32Array(numSubdivisions * 2 * 3 * 2);
    const vertexData = new Float32Array(numVertices * (2 + 3));

    let offset = 0;
    const addVertex = (x, y, r, g, b) => {
        vertexData[offset++] = x;
        vertexData[offset++] = y;
        vertexData[offset++] = r;
        vertexData[offset++] = g;
        vertexData[offset++] = b;
    };

    const innerColor = [0.3, 0.3, 0.9];
    const outerColor = [0.9, 0.9, 0.9];

    // 2 triangles per subdivision
    //
    // 0  2  4  6  8 ...
    //
    // 1  3  5  7  9 ...
    for (let i = 0; i <= numSubdivisions; ++i) {
        const angle = startAngle + (i + 0) * (endAngle - startAngle) / numSubdivisions;

        const c1 = Math.cos(angle);
        const s1 = Math.sin(angle);

        addVertex(c1 * radius, s1 * radius, ...outerColor);
        addVertex(c1 * innerRadius, s1 * innerRadius, ...innerColor);
    }

    const indexData = new Uint32Array(numSubdivisions * 6);
    let ndx = 0;

    // 1st tri  2nd tri  3rd tri  4th tri
    // 0 1 2    2 1 3    2 3 4    4 3 5
    //
    // 0--2        2     2--4        4  .....
    // | /        /|     | /        /|
    // |/        / |     |/        / |
    // 1        1--3     3        3--5  .....
    for (let i = 0; i < numSubdivisions; ++i) {
        const ndxOffset = i * 2;

        // first triangle
        indexData[ndx++] = ndxOffset;
        indexData[ndx++] = ndxOffset + 1;
        indexData[ndx++] = ndxOffset + 2;

        // second triangle
        indexData[ndx++] = ndxOffset + 2;
        indexData[ndx++] = ndxOffset + 1;
        indexData[ndx++] = ndxOffset + 3;
    }

    return {
        vertexData,
        indexData,
        numVertices: indexData.length,
    };
}
```
We then set Index Buffer as well to pass our index data.
We also need to call different draw function:
```javascript
        pass.drawIndexed(numVertices, kNumObjects);
```
And we **saved 33% vertices**, slay!
This is what's we're getting by the way:

Now we're ready to go to **textures**.

#### Textures

Okay, we're finally at the last part of passing data into the WebGPU shaders!

The major difference for textures is that they are accessed by **sampler**, which can blend up to 16 values together in a texture.
As if there was not enough new information before yay....

The first thing I noticed when started following the lesson is **flipped textures,** which we faced a lot during Bachelor Thesis, and here was the eplanation for that:

![indexBuffer](/shaders-research-blog/images/flipped-textures.png)

It was also nice finally to see familiar things about UV explanation and mixing, this is something I've encountered before and is easier for comprehension=)
I think I finally understood meaning of **magFilter** and clamping textures to edge / repeating, which I saw in three js before very briefly:
![magFilter](/shaders-research-blog/images/magFilter.png)

It's nice knowing that even if I am not writing shaders low-level daily, I understand how graphics api works in general better!
