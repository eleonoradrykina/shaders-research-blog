On Sunday I combed through Twitter and fished out some links that *seem useful* at the first glance.
I have not read them closely yet, only scanned through but I just want to dump everything I found here, just in case:

| SL / API    | Links |
| -------- | ------- |
| WGSL  / WebGPU  | [Okay Dev article about WebGPU](https://okaydev.co/articles/dive-into-webgpu-part-1)   |
| WGSL  / WebGPU  | [React Three Fiber WebGPU Post Processing (probably just a set up with no WGSl involved)](https://github.com/ektogamat/r3f-webgpu-starter)|
| WebGPU   | [ Interacting with meshes in WebGPU ](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/patient-lake-9sh577?file=%2Fsrc%2FApp.js)|
| TSL    | [ Editor that generates TSL code](https://tsl-editor.vercel.app/) |
| TSL  | [Youtube tutorial of Yuri Artiukh](https://www.youtube.com/live/Wgz3u-6tg28?si=cQtVlmS1eQDNip5B) (I actually follow him nearly everywhere but did not get a chance to use his tutorials)  |
| TSL  | [ 2D Clouds in TSL]( https://niklever.com/get-to-grips-with-threejs-shading-language-tsl-part-13-2d-clouds/)  |


*I noticed that Okay Dev use Megazoid font that I used for my NailBro project during first year, so I already trust them.*
