Today is Saturday and I want just a chill day making everything nice and pretty, and uncanny, of course.

First of all I've noticed my liminal space is not yellow enough, so let's fix it.
This is more yellow, but it will also make more sense when we add real light:

#### Lights
First, we can add a bit of yellow color into the ambient light. This will mix all the colors nicely and contrast with our blueish bloom.

Secondly, the bloom effect does not actually lights up our walls and floor and does not cast shadows. Let's see what we could add. 
I have **9 fake lights with Bloom effect,** but I don't want to put **9 lights** there because it is **not good for the performance.** Instead, I will try to fake the light with three js lights like it's coming from my ceiling lamps.
Becaue the whole scene is surreal and a bit off, I think it can be okay if it is not 100% realistic.

At first, I thought maybe I could get away with 3 spotlights, each spotlight for one row of lights:

This is not it at all, and the shadows mixing seems extremely weird and dirty.

Then I thought maybe directional light? It gave better shadows, but the light itself did not make sense.
What I want is some rooms being lit up and some places beind darker so you're a bit scared to go in there.

So then I decided to place pointlights into my rooms near the fale lamps. Sometimes I've placed them right into the lamos, and sometimes a bit next to it to get a wider area lit:

![point-light-3](/shaders-research-blog/images/point-light-3.png)
Check out the **bump map** on the ceiling! Now you can really see it, nice!
Such a nice result with just  reusing mixing of colors for bump texture:
``csm_Bump = vec3((1.0 - strength) * 0.4);``

I have only 1 ambient light and 4 pointlights and I have quite a scary scene already hihihi

Before going further to the wallpapers, I also clamped the camera position so that camera can not go outside the room anymore.

#### Wallpaper
I spent a little bit more time than expected on lights, checking camera, and then scrolling through Shader Toy for inspiration and then not finding anything, so for now I added just simple shell-like ornaments:

I also noticed that my UV logic resolution does not work on the seashell turning them into croissants on another wall:

For now its time to switch to other rooms & demos!
