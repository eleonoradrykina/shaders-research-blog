Wouter suggested to start with [WebGPU Fundamentals](https://webgpufundamentals.org/webgpu/lessons/webgpu-how-it-works.html#toc), where I accidentally opened a lesson from the middle instead of the beginning.\n\n#### WebGPU Fundamentals && Tour of WGSL\nSeeing snippets of WGSL code I was quite lost, but then I saw [Tour of WGSL](https://google.github.io/tour-of-wgsl/).\nTo understand the context better, I have decided to try out WGSL directly, so I went through the half of the tour and saved some memroy anchors to my figma conspect:\n![WGSL Figma concept](/shaders-research-blog/images/conspect.png)\n\nTo get more comfortable with WGSL, I decided to use a turn a little example from **Book of Shaders into WGSL:**\n```javascript\n@binding(0) @group(0) var\u003Cuniform> frame : u32;\n\n@vertex\nfn vtx_main(@builtin(vertex_index) vertex_index : u32) -> @builtin(position) vec4f {\n  const pos = array(\n    vec2( 0.0,  1.0),\n    vec2( -1.0, -1.0),\n    vec2( 1.0, -1.0),\n  );\n\n  return vec4f(pos[vertex_index], 0, 1);\n}\n//https://thebookofshaders.com/08/\n// YUV to RGB matrix\nconst yuv2rgb = mat3x3f(1.0, 0.0, 1.13983,\n                    1.0, -0.39465, -0.58060,\n                    1.0, 2.03211, 0.0);\n\n@fragment\nfn frag_main() -> @location(0) vec4f {\n  var color : vec3f = yuv2rgb * vec3f(0.5, sin(f32(frame) / 128), 0.5);\n  return vec4(color, 1);\n}\n```\n\n**Multiplying colors by YUV matrix** turned from yellowish-greenish triangle into cyan, although it's not quite clear on the hero Image of the post, we all need to start somewhere=).\nOn my way there I also got a bit distracted with a [reminder how multiplying matrices works](https://mathinsight.org/matrix_vector_multiplication#:~:text=Matrix%2Dvector%20product&text=If%20we%20let%20Ax,na21a22%E2%80%A6), I had a vague memory from high school but wanted to understand the outcome better.\n\nThen I re-read Fundamentals articles again and I feel how it starts to layer in my head.\n\n#### Three.js Shading Language\n\nWhile trying to understand how WebGPU works, I wanted to make sure to understand the **difference between WGSL and TSL.** After scanning documentation and examples, I wasn't quite sure I understood it correctly. \nThe examples on three js website do contain TSL already used with WebGPU, but not shaders written in WGSl. Lately when I need to summarise new things I learned I ask ChatGpt to explain me concepts as an example of pizzeria:\n![TSL-pizza](/shaders-research-blog/images/TSL-pizza.png)\n\n\n#### Planning\nFor tomorrow I am planning to:\n- map out the roadmap;\n- start from [proper beginning of WebGPU Fundamentals](https://webgpufundamentals.org/webgpu/lessons/webgpu-fundamentals.html) again;\n- re-visit [this article about differences between WebGL and WebGPU](https://webgpufundamentals.org/webgpu/lessons/webgpu-from-webgl.html), as it brings more clarity to me:\n![conspect-3](/shaders-research-blog/images/conspect-3.png)\nI also saved this comparison\n![conspect-2](/shaders-research-blog/images/conspect-2.png)\n\nBy the way, I just learned that actually its best practice **not to use ternary opeartors, or any flow controls,** when writing GLSL code as it's not good for performance, it might apply to WGSL as well.\n\n\n*My research might seem not linear right now, but I need to get the gist of the context and try out things to better understand the basics.*","src/content/blog/01-08-first-wgsl-shader.mdx","7e3330e00d2b632b","01-09-roadmap",{"id":40,"data":42,"body":47,"filePath":48,"digest":49,"deferredRender":19},{"title":43,"description":44,"pubDate":45,"heroImage":46},"Timeline","Timeplanning",["Date","2025-01-08T23:00:00.000Z"],"timeline.png","import Takeaway from \"../../components/Takeaway.astro\";\n\n#### Roadmap\n\nI tried to come up with a roadmap for my research, but for now I was able only to have very rough timeline:\n![timeline](/shaders-research-blog/images/timeline.png)\n\nI think of my features more of like happy accidents during research, but I will plan them more precisely this week for sure.\nMeanwhile, I also went back to the very beginning of WebGPU Fundamentals.\n\n#### WebGPU Fundamentals\n\nThe first thing that caught my eye was that **WebGPU is an asynchronous API** and is used inside of an **async function**.\nAnother thing was **requesting an adaper**:\n```javascript\nasync function main() {\n  const adapter = await navigator.gpu?.requestAdapter();\n  const device = await adapter?.requestDevice();\n  if (!device) {\n    fail('need a browser that supports WebGPU');\n    return;\n  }\n}\nmain();\n```\nThe adapter represents a specific GPU. Some devices have multiple GPUs.\n\nOkay, now an important takeaway:\n\u003CTakeaway>\n\"Shaders are written in a language called WebGPU Shading Language (WGSL) which is often pronounced wig-sil.\"\nI need to train it more: ***WIG-SIL***\n\u003C/Takeaway>\n\nBy the time I got to a red triangle on canvas, I had this conspect in Figma:\n\n![conspect](/shaders-research-blog/images/WebGPU-setup.png)\n\nNow it makes more sense, so we can move further to **running computations on the GPU.**","src/content/blog/01-09-roadmap.mdx","589fd2ba10444241","01-10-computing-shaders",{"id":50,"data":52,"body":57,"filePath":58,"digest":59,"deferredRender":19},{"title":53,"description":54,"pubDate":55,"heroImage":56},"Computing shaders","Continiuing with WGSL",["Date","2025-01-09T23:00:00.000Z"],"vert-frag.png","import Takeaway from \"../../components/Takeaway.astro\";\n\n#### Computing Shaders\nToday I started with WebGPU Fundamentals again, going further to Computing shaders.\n\nThe first thing that is different from yesterdays **fragment** and **vertex** shaders is that we need **storage variable**:\n```javascript\n      @group(0) @binding(0) var\u003Cstorage, read_write> data: array\u003Cf32>;\n```\nThe thing that still confuses me a bit is *locations* in WGSL shaders:\n\"We tell it we’re going to specify this array on binding location 0 (the binding(0)) in bindGroup 0 (the @group(0)).\"\n\nThings get more interesting when we need to create separate buffers to **store** the data in and to **read** the data from:\n```javascript\n  //data for compute shader\n  const input = new Float32Array([1, 3, 5]);\n\n  //For WebGPU to use it, we need to make a buffer that exists on the GPU and copy the data to the buffer.\n\n  // create a buffer on the GPU to hold our computation\n  // input and output\n  const workBuffer = device.createBuffer({\n    label: 'work buffer',\n    size: input.byteLength,\n    usage: GPUBufferUsage.STORAGE | GPUBufferUsage.COPY_SRC | GPUBufferUsage.COPY_DST,\n  });\n  // Copy our input data to that buffer\n  device.queue.writeBuffer(workBuffer, 0, input);\n\n  // create a buffer on the GPU to get a copy of the results\n  const resultBuffer = device.createBuffer({\n    label: 'result buffer',\n    size: input.byteLength,\n    usage: GPUBufferUsage.MAP_READ | GPUBufferUsage.COPY_DST\n  });\n\n  // Setup a bindGroup to tell the shader which\n  // buffer to use for the computation\n  const bindGroup = device.createBindGroup({\n    label: 'bindGroup for work buffer',\n    layout: pipeline.getBindGroupLayout(0),\n    entries: [\n      { binding: 0, resource: { buffer: workBuffer } },\n    ],\n  });\n  ```\n\n  #### WebGPU Inter-stage Variables\n\n  Moving on to WebGPU Inter-stage Variables, in next chapter I learned how to pass structures (of which I think kind of like js classes) between 2 shaders:\n\n  ```javascript\n        struct OurVertexShaderOutput {\n        @builtin(position) position: vec4f,\n        @location(0) color: vec4f,\n      };\n      @vertex fn vs(\n        @builtin(vertex_index) vertexIndex : u32\n     ) -> OurVertexShaderOutput {\n        let pos = array(\n          vec2f( 0.0,  0.5),  // top center\n          vec2f(-0.5, -0.5),  // bottom left\n          vec2f( 0.5, -0.5)   // bottom right\n        );\n\n        let color = array(\n          vec4f(1, 0, 0, 1), // red\n          vec4f(0, 1, 0, 1), // green\n          vec4f(0, 0, 1, 1), // blue\n        );\n \n        var vsOutput: OurVertexShaderOutput;\n        vsOutput.position = vec4f(pos[vertexIndex], 0.0, 1.0);\n        vsOutput.color = color[vertexIndex];\n        return vsOutput;\n      }\n \n       @fragment fn fs(fsInput: OurVertexShaderOutput) -> @location(0) vec4f {\n        let red = vec4f(1, 0, 0, 1);\n        let colored = fsInput.color;\n\n        let grid = vec2u(fsInput.position.xy) / 16;\n        let checker = (grid.x + grid.y) % 2 == 1;\n\n        return select(red, colored, checker);\n      }\n  ```\nHere I combined 2 examples to both **pass color from vertex shader to frag shader**, and to add **condition** to use the **passed color or red** in frag shader.\nThis is the outcome:\n![vertex-to-frag](/shaders-research-blog/images/vert-frag.png)\n\n#### Uniforms\nUniforms look just like in GLSL with some differences:\nto create a Uniform, first we need to descripe its' \"class\" aka struct:\n\n```javascript\n    struct OurStruct {\n        color: vec4f,\n        scale: vec2f,\n        offset: vec2f,\n      };\n```\n\nThen, we need to declare a uniform with type of our struct:\n\n```javascript\n@group(0) @binding(0) var\u003Cuniform> ourStruct: OurStruct;\n```\nand after this we can use uniforms in our shader code.\nTo be able to se the from Javascript, we also need to create a buffer first, and to calculate it's size:\n```javascript  \nconst uniformBufferSize =\n    4 * 4 + // color is 4 32bit floats (4bytes each)\n    2 * 4 + // scale is 2 32bit floats (4bytes each)\n    2 * 4;  // offset is 2 32bit floats (4bytes each)\n  const uniformBuffer = device.createBuffer({\n    label: 'uniforms for triangle',\n    size: uniformBufferSize,\n    usage: GPUBufferUsage.UNIFORM | GPUBufferUsage.COPY_DST,\n  });\n  ```\n  after playing with setting uniforms a bit, I got this beautiful rotating triangle:\n\n![rotating-trinagle](/shaders-research-blog/images/wgsl-uniforms.gif)","src/content/blog/01-10-computing-shaders.mdx","78a51b5f49614566"]
